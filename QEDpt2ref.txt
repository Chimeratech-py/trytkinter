So anyway, how does that even work?
Let's start with some investors
First, let's take their pictures away
So, let's say I start a Ponzi scheme, and what I do is set up those investors, and here they are
And then, let's say, we also have some time periods
This is where we can see why at first glance, my "business" is legitimate
Here are the time periods, we have period one, let's say it's the first year, second year, third, fourth and fifth
What I will do is that I'll write to every investor
I'll write how much money they think they have on me, as promoters of the Ponzi scheme
Here is Investor A
And that's what they think their money is worth. The "perceived value"
And here, I'm going to write about the total actual value. So, if you think about it, it's the actual amount of money I have
Investor A in blue, and let's say in the first year, he gave me $10,000
And I said, I have a way to double his money next year
In the second year, I didn't really do anything with the money and I could even spend it on myself
Instead, let's just say the money was saved in the bank. So, he gave me $10,000 and let’s pretend I didn’t touch it
Let’s also say that the money has no interest
Or the money is just hidden under my mattress
I promised him I was a genius who could double his money in a year
He still hopes it will double it again
