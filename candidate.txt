From Migrant Worker to Activist
[Talking on the phone]:
It was caused by over contract.
The contract expired.
When coming home, it would be a problem if she doesn't get her rights.
She should come home bringing what she's entitled to, like her salary and others.
Hety was a migrant worker who faced abuses from her boss.
She had returned home and is now actively giving counseling and education to potential migrant workers in the village she resides.
She works in the Middle East and now she is asking for the help from SBMC (Migrant Workers Solidarity in Cianjur).
We asked her to write the chronology of her case.
After that we can meet up in the City of Cianjur.
If there is problem, such as her salary not being given, we will call the boss, to ask for her to be sent home.
Aside being sent home, she should also be entitled to her rights, like her salary.
If she comes home without bringing her salary, it would not be good.
Right?
They have been working for three years.
In Saudi Arabia.
Both husband and wife.
She's coming home tomorrow.
She flew out yesterday at 4 pm.
The first time it was only two months, and then she left again.
It has been three years now and she doesn't want to come home.
It might also be because her husband had passed away.
So she extended her contract for another two months.
Thank God, she becomes a successful migrant worker.
Once or twice a week, her father comes to clean the house.
