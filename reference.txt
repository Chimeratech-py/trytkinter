From OFW to activist
Speaking on the phone:
Because the contract has passed.
The contract is done.
It will be a problem if she doesn't get her rights when she comes home.
She must come home bringing along with her what is rightfully hers, like her salary and others.
Hety is an OFW who experienced abuse from her boss.
She went home to provide lectures and support to others who will also become OFWs in her province.
She is currently working in the Middle East and is now asking for assistance from the SBMC (Migrant Workers Solidarity in Cianjur)
We asked for the sequence of events regarding the case she filed
Afterwards we can have the opportunity to meet at the Ciudad of Cianjur
If she experiences a problem such as not receiving compensation for her services, we shall call her boss to ask for her safe return home
Aside from her return, she should also be given what she is entitled to, such as her salary.
It wouldn't be right if she comes home without being properly compensated,
right?
They have been working for three years

The married couple
The lady is coming home tomorrow
She took a flight home at four in the afternoon
During her first time, just for two months, then she left again
It's been three years and she doesn't want to go home anymore
It's probably because of the death of her husband
That's why she asked for her contract to be extended by two months
Thank God, she's a successful OFW
Her father cleans the house once or twice a week
